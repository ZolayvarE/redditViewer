#Eric's Reddit Viewer

A platform for conveniently browsing multiple subreddits simultaneously.

##How to set up
Ideally, you can avoid setup altogether by just viewing the deployed version here:

If you want to run it locally, then you have to have NodeJS installed. Once that is done, you have to install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following in the root of the project directory.
```bash
npm install
```
You will also have to run npm install in the client directory as well.

Then after that is done, execute the following bash command in the root directory of the project folder.
```bash
npm compile
```
Then run
```bash
npm start
```
Then you can navigate to localhost:8080 in your local browser to see the locally running instance of the server.

Thanks!
